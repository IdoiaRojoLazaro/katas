# Kata Repository with TypeScript

Welcome to the Kata repository! These katas are a collection of existing exercises selected to improve skills and practice best coding practices.

## About the Katas

Each kata in this repository is a practical exercise designed to enhance coding skills and promote the adoption of best practices in software development. These katas cover a wide range of topics and challenges, providing valuable learning opportunities for developers at all levels.

## Development Approach

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Each kata was developed using a Test-Driven Development approach, ensuring that the codebase is thoroughly tested and reliable.

- **Jest**: The test framework Jest was used to write and run tests for each kata, ensuring comprehensive test coverage and reliable code.

## Repository Structure

Each kata is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the implementations of the katas in TypeScript.
  - `core/`: Core logic for each kata.
- `test/`: Contains the associated test files for the katas.
- `README.md`: Providing detailed instructions and explanations.
